<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>Some of the evil of my tale may have been inherent in our
circumstances. For years we lived anyhow with one another in the
naked desert, under the indifferent heaven. By day the hot sun
fermented us; and we were dizzied by the beating wind. At night we
were stained by dew, and shamed into pettiness by the innumerable
silences of stars. We were a self-centred army without parade or
gesture, devoted to freedom, the second of man's creeds, a purpose
so ravenous that it devoured all our strength, a hope so
transcendent that our earlier ambitions faded in its glare.</p>

<p>As time went by our need to fight for the ideal increased to an
unquestioning possession, riding with spur and rein over our
doubts. Willy-nilly it became a faith. We had sold ourselves into
its slavery, manacled ourselves together in its chain-gang, bowed
ourselves to serve its holiness with all our good and ill content.
The mentality of ordinary human slaves is terrible&mdash;they have
lost the world&mdash;and we had surrendered, not body alone, but
soul to the overmastering greed of victory. By our own act we were
drained of morality, of volition, of responsibility, like dead
leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>The everlasting battle stripped from us care of our own lives or
of others'. We had ropes about our necks, and on our heads prices
which showed that the enemy intended hideous tortures for us if we
were caught. Each day some of us passed; and the living knew
themselves just sentient puppets on God's stage: indeed, our
taskmaster was merciless, merciless, so long as our bruised feet
could stagger forward on the road. The weak envied those tired
enough to die; for success looked so remote, and failure a near and
certain, if sharp, release from toil. We lived always in the
stretch or sag of nerves, either on the crest or in the trough of
waves of feeling. This impotency was bitter to us, and made us live
only for the seen horizon, reckless what spite we inflicted or
endured, since physical sensation showed itself meanly transient.
Gusts of cruelty, perversions, lusts ran lightly over the surface
without troubling us; for the moral laws which had seemed to hedge
about these silly accidents must be yet fainter words. We had
learned that there were pangs too sharp, griefs too deep, ecstasies
too high for our finite selves to register. When emotion reached
this pitch the mind choked; and memory went white till the
circumstances were humdrum once more.</p>

<p>Such exaltation of thought, while it let adrift the spirit, and
gave it licence in strange airs, lost it the old patient rule over
the body. The body was too coarse to feel the utmost of our sorrows
and of our joys. Therefore, we abandoned it as rubbish: we left it
below us to march forward, a breathing simulacrum, on its own
unaided level, subject to influences from which in normal times our
instincts would have shrunk. The men were young and sturdy; and hot
flesh and blood unconsciously claimed a right in them and tormented
their bellies with strange longings. Our privations and dangers
fanned this virile heat, in a climate as racking as can be
conceived. We had no shut places to be alone in, no thick clothes
to hide our nature. Man in all things lived candidly with man.</p>

<p>The Arab was by nature continent; and the use of universal
marriage had nearly abolished irregular courses in his tribes. The
public women of the rare settlements we encountered in our months
of wandering would have been nothing to our numbers, even had their
raddled meat been palatable to a man of healthy parts. In horror of
such sordid commerce our youths began indifferently to slake one
another's few needs in their own clean bodies&mdash;a cold
convenience that, by comparison, seemed sexless and even pure.
Later, some began to justify this sterile process, and swore that
friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot
limbs in supreme embrace, found there hidden in the darkness a
sensual co-efficient of the mental passion which was welding our
souls and spirits in one flaming effort. Several, thirsting to
punish appetites they could not wholly prevent, took a savage pride
in degrading the body, and offered themselves fiercely in any habit
which promised physical pain or filth.</p>

<p>I was sent to these Arabs as a stranger, unable to think their
thoughts or subscribe their beliefs, but charged by duty to lead
them forward and to develop to the highest any movement of theirs
profitable to England in her war. If I could not assume their
character, I could at least conceal my own, and pass among them
without evident friction, neither a discord nor a critic but an
unnoticed influence. Since I was their fellow, I will not be their
apologist or advocate. To-day in my old garments, I could play the
bystander, obedient to the sensibilities of our theatre...but it is
more honest to record that these ideas and actions then passed
naturally. What now looks wanton or sadic seemed in the field
inevitable, or just unimportant routine.</p>

<p>Blood was always on our hands: we were licensed to it. Wounding
and killing seemed ephemeral pains, so very brief and sore was life
with us. With the sorrow of living so great, the sorrow of
punishment had to be pitiless. We lived for the day and died for
it. When there was reason and desire to punish we wrote our lesson
with gun or whip immediately in the sullen flesh of the sufferer,
and the case was beyond appeal. The desert did not afford the
refined slow penalties of courts and gaols.</p>

<p>Of course our rewards and pleasures were as suddenly sweeping as
our troubles; but, to me in particular, they bulked less large.
Bedouin ways were hard even for those brought up to them, and for
strangers terrible: a death in life. When the march or labour ended
I had no energy to record sensation, nor while it lasted any
leisure to see the spiritual loveliness which sometimes came upon
us by the way. In my notes, the cruel rather than the beautiful
found place. We no doubt enjoyed more the rare moments of peace and
forgetfulness; but I remember more the agony, the terrors, and the
mistakes. Our life is not summed up in what I have written (there
are things not to be repeated in cold blood for very shame); but
what I have written was in and of our life. Pray God that men
reading the story will not, for love of the glamour of strangeness,
go out to prostitute themselves and their talents in serving
another race.</p>

<p>A man who gives himself to be a possession of aliens leads a
Yahoo life, having bartered his soul to a brute-master. He is not
of them. He may stand against them, persuade himself of a mission,
batter and twist them into something which they, of their own
accord, would not have been. Then he is exploiting his old
environment to press them out of theirs. Or, after my model, he may
imitate them so well that they spuriously imitate him back again.
Then he is giving away his own environment: pretending to theirs;
and pretences are hollow, worthless things. In neither case does he
do a thing of himself, nor a thing so clean as to be his own
(without thought of conversion), letting them take what action or
reaction they please from the silent example.</p>

<p>In my case, the effort for these years to live in the dress of
Arabs, and to imitate their mental foundation, quitted me of my
English self, and let me look at the West and its conventions with
new eyes: they destroyed it all for me. At the same time I could
not sincerely take on the Arab skin: it was an affectation only.
Easily was a man made an infidel, but hardly might he be converted
to another faith. I had dropped one form and not taken on the
other, and was become like Mohammed's coffin in our legend, with a
resultant feeling of intense loneliness in life, and a contempt,
not for other men, but for all they do. Such detachment came at
times to a man exhausted by prolonged physical effort and
isolation. His body plodded on mechanically, while his reasonable
mind left him, and from without looked down critically on him,
wondering what that futile lumber did and why. Sometimes these
selves would converse in the void; and then madness was very near,
as I believe it would be near the man who could see things through
the veils at once of two customs, two educations, two
environments.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>A first difficulty of the Arab movement was to say who the Arabs
were. Being a manufactured people, their name had been changing in
sense slowly year by year. Once it meant an Arabian. There was a
country called Arabia; but this was nothing to the point. There was
a language called Arabic; and in it lay the test. It was the
current tongue of Syria and Palestine, of Mesopotamia, and of the
great peninsula called Arabia on the map. Before the Moslem
conquest, these areas were inhabited by diverse peoples, speaking
languages of the Arabic family. We called them Semitic, but (as
with most scientific terms) incorrectly. However, Arabic, Assyrian,
Babylonian, Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac were related
tongues; and indications of common influences in the past, or even
of a common origin, were strengthened by our knowledge that the
appearances and customs of the present Arabic-speaking peoples of
Asia, while as varied as a field&mdash;full of poppies, had an
equal and essential likeness. We might with perfect propriety call
them cousins&mdash;and cousins certainly, if sadly, aware of their
own relationship.</p>

<p>The Arabic-speaking areas of Asia in this sense were a rough
parallelogram. The northern side ran from Alexandretta, on the
Mediterranean, across Mesopotamia eastward to the Tigris. The south
side was the edge of the Indian Ocean, from Aden to Muscat. On the
west it was bounded by the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the
Red Sea to Aden. On the east by the Tigris, and the Persian Gulf to
Muscat. This square of land, as large as India, formed the homeland
of our Semites, in which no foreign race had kept a permanent
footing, though Egyptians, Hittites, Philistines, Persians, Greeks,
Romans, Turks and Franks had variously tried. All had in the end
been broken, and their scattered elements drowned in the strong
characteristics of the Semitic race. Semites had sometimes pushed
outside this area, and themselves been drowned in the outer world.
Egypt, Algiers, Morocco, Malta, Sicily, Spain, Cilicia and France
absorbed and obliterated Semitic colonies. Only in Tripoli of
Africa, and in the everlasting miracle of Jewry, had distant
Semites kept some of their identity and force.</p>

<p>The origin of these peoples was an academic question; but for
the understanding of their revolt their present social and
political differences were important, and could only be grasped by
looking at their geography. This continent of theirs fell into
certain great regions, whose gross physical diversities imposed
varying habits on the dwellers in them. On the west the
parallelogram was framed, from Alexandretta to Aden, by a mountain
belt, called (in the north) Syria, and thence progressively
southward called Palestine, Midian, Hejaz, and lastly Yemen. It had
an average height of perhaps three thousand feet, with peaks of ten
to twelve thousand feet. It faced west, was well watered with rain
and cloud from the sea, and in general was fully peopled.</p>

<p>Another range of inhabited hills, facing the Indian Ocean, was
the south edge of the parallelogram. The eastern frontier was at
first an alluvial plain called Mesopotamia, but south of Basra a
level littoral, called Kuweit, and Hasa, to Gattar. Much of this
plain was peopled. These inhabited hills and plains framed a gulf
of thirsty desert, in whose heart was an archipelago of watered and
populous oases called Kasim and Aridh. In this group of oases lay
the true centre of Arabia, the preserve of its native spirit, and
its most conscious individuality. The desert lapped it round and
kept it pure of contact.</p>

<p>The desert which performed this great function around the oases,
and so made the character of Arabia, varied in nature. South of the
oases it appeared to be a pathless sea of sand, stretching nearly
to the populous escarpment of the Indian Ocean shore, shutting it
out from Arabian history, and from all influence on Arabian morals
and politics. Hadhramaut, as they called this southern coast,
formed part of the history of the Dutch Indies; and its thought
swayed Java rather than Arabia. To the west of the oases, between
them and the Hejaz hills, was the Nejd desert, an area of gravel
and lava, with little sand in it. To the east of these oases,
between them and Kuweit, spread a similar expanse of gravel, but
with some great stretches of soft sand, making the road difficult.
To the north of the oases lay a belt of sand, and then an immense
gravel and lava plain, filling up everything between the eastern
edge of Syria and the banks of the Euphrates where Mesopotamia
began. The practicability of this northern desert for men and
motor-cars enabled the Arab revolt to win its ready success.</p>

<p>The hills of the west and the plains of the east were the parts
of Arabia always most populous and active. In particular on the
west, the mountains of Syria and Palestine, of Hejaz and Yemen,
entered time and again into the current of our European life.
Ethically, these fertile healthy hills were in Europe, not in Asia,
just as the Arabs looked always to the Mediterranean, not to the
Indian Ocean, for their cultural sympathies, for their enterprises,
and particularly for their expansions, since the migration problem
was the greatest and most complex force in Arabia, and general to
it, however it might vary in the different Arabic districts.</p>

<p>In the north (Syria) the birth rate was low in the cities and
the death rate high, because of the insanitary conditions and the
hectic life led by the majority. Consequently the surplus peasantry
found openings in the towns, and were there swallowed up. In the
Lebanon, where sanitation had been improved, a greater exodus of
youth took place to America each year, threatening (for the first
time since Greek days) to change the outlook of an entire
district.</p>

<p>In Yemen the solution was different. There was no foreign trade,
and no massed industries to accumulate population in unhealthy
places. The towns were just market towns, as clean and simple as
ordinary villages. Therefore the population slowly increased; the
scale of living was brought down very low; and a congestion of
numbers was generally felt. They could not emigrate overseas; for
the Sudan was even worse country than Arabia, and the few tribes
which did venture across were compelled to modify their manner of
life and their Semitic culture profoundly, in order to exist. They
could not move northward along the hills; for these were barred by
the holy town of Mecca and its port Jidda: an alien belt,
continually reinforced by strangers from India and Java and Bokhara
and Africa, very strong in vitality, violently hostile to the
Semitic consciousness, and maintained despite economics and
geography and climate by the artificial factor of a world-religion.
The congestion of Yemen, therefore, becoming extreme, found its
only relief in the east, by forcing the weaker aggregations of its
border down and down the slopes of the hills along the Widian, the
half-waste district of the great water-bearing valleys of Bisha,
Dawasir, Ranya and Taraba, which ran out towards the deserts of
Nejd. These weaker clans had continually to exchange good springs
and fertile palms for poorer springs and scantier palms, till at
last they reached an area where a proper agricultural life became
impossible. They then began to eke out their precarious husbandry
by breeding sheep and camels, and in time came to depend more and
more on these herds for their living.</p>

<p>Finally, under a last impulse from the straining population
behind them, the border people (now almost wholly pastoral), were
flung out of the furthest crazy oasis into the untrodden wilderness
as nomads. This process, to be watched to-day with individual
families and tribes to whose marches an exact name and date might
be put, must have been going on since the first day of full
settlement of Yemen. The Widian below Mecca and Taif are crowded
with the memories and place-names of half a hundred tribes which
have gone from there, and may be found to-day in Nejd, in Jebel
Sham-mar, in the Hamad, even on the frontiers of Syria and
Mesopotamia. There was the source of migration, the factory of
nomads, the springing of the gulf-stream of desert wanderers.</p>

<p>For the people of the desert were as little static as the people
of the hills. The economic life of the desert was based on the
supply of camels, which were best bred on the rigorous upland
pastures with their strong nutritive thorns. By this industry the
Bedouins lived; and it in turn moulded their life, apportioned the
tribal areas, and kept the clans revolving through their rote of
spring, summer and winter pasturages, as the herds cropped the
scanty growths of each in turn. The camel markets in Syria,
Mesopotamia, and Egypt determined the population which the deserts
could support, and regulated strictly their standard of living. So
the desert likewise overpeopled itself upon occasion; and then
there were heavings and thrustings of the crowded tribes as they
elbowed themselves by natural courses towards the light. They might
not go south towards the inhospitable sand or sea. They could not
turn west; for there the steep hills of Hejaz were thickly lined by
mountain peoples taking full advantage of their defensiveness.
Sometimes they went towards the central oases of Aridh and Kasim,
and, if the tribes looking for new homes were strong and vigorous,
might succeed in occupying parts of them. If, however, the desert
had not this strength, its peoples were pushed gradually north, up
between Medina of the Hejaz and Kasim of Nejd, till they found
themselves at the fork of two roads. They could strike eastward, by
Wadi Rumh or Jebel Sham-mar, to follow eventually the Batn to
Shamiya, where they would become riverine Arabs of the Lower
Euphrates; or they could climb, by slow degrees, the ladder of
western oases&mdash;Henakiya, Kheibar, Teima, Jauf, and the
Sirhan&mdash;till fate saw them nearing Jebel Druse, in Syria, or
watering their herds about Tadmor of the northern desert, on their
way to Aleppo or Assyria.</p>

<p>Nor then did the pressure cease: the inexorable trend northward
continued. The tribes found themselves driven to the very edge of
cultivation in Syria or Mesopotamia. Opportunity and their bellies
persuaded them of the advantages of possessing goats, and then of
possessing sheep; and lastly they began to sow, if only a little
barley for their animals. They were now no longer Bedouin, and
began to suffer like the villagers from the ravages of the nomads
behind. Insensibly, they made common cause with the peasants
already on the soil, and found out that they, too, were peasantry.
So we see clans, born in the highlands of Yemen, thrust by stronger
clans into the desert, where, unwillingly, they became nomad to
keep themselves alive. We see them wandering, every year moving a
little further north or a little further east as chance has sent
them down one or other of the well-roads of the wilderness, till
finally this pressure drives them from the desert again into the
sown, with the like unwillingness of their first shrinking
experiment in nomad life. This was the circulation which kept
vigour in the Semitic body. There were few, if indeed there was a
single northern Semite, whose ancestors had not at some dark age
passed through the desert. The mark of nomadism, that most deep and
biting social discipline, was on each of them in his degree.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>If tribesman and townsman in Arabic-speaking Asia were not
different races, but just men in different social and economic
stages, a family resemblance might be expected in the working of
their minds, and so it was only reasonable that common elements
should appear in the product of all these peoples. In the very
outset, at the first meeting with them, was found a universal
clearness or hardness of belief, almost mathematical in its
limitation, and repellent in its unsympathetic form. Semites had no
half-tones in their register of vision. They were a people of
primary colours, or rather of black and white, who saw the world
always in contour. They were a dogmatic people, despising doubt,
our modern crown of thorns. They did not understand our
metaphysical difficulties, our introspective questionings. They
knew only truth and untruth, belief and unbelief, without our
hesitating retinue of finer shades.</p>

<p>This people was black and white, not only in vision, but by
inmost furnishing: black and white not merely in clarity, but in
apposition. Their thoughts were at ease only in extremes. They
inhabited superlatives by choice. Sometimes inconsistents seemed to
possess them at once in joint sway; but they never compromised:
they pursued the logic of several incompatible opinions to absurd
ends, without perceiving the incongruity. With cool head and
tranquil judgement, imperturbably unconscious of the flight, they
oscillated from asymptote to asymptote.*</p>

<p>They were a limited, narrow-minded people, whose inert
intellects lay fallow in incurious resignation. Their imaginations
were vivid, but not creative. There was so little Arab art in Asia
that they could almost be said to have had no art, though their
classes were liberal patrons, and had encouraged whatever talents
in architecture, or ceramics, or other handicraft their neighbours
and helots displayed. Nor did they handle great industries: they
had no organizations of mind or body. They invented no systems of
philosophy, no complex mythologies. They steered their course
between the idols of the tribe and of the cave. The least morbid of
peoples, they had accepted the gift of life unquestioningly, as
axiomatic. To them it was a thing inevitable, entailed on man, a
usufruct, beyond control. Suicide was a thing impossible, and death
no grief.</p>

<p>They were a people of spasms, of upheavals, of ideas, the race
of the individual genius. Their movements were the more shocking by
contrast with the quietude of every day, their great men greater by
contrast with the humanity of their mob. Their convictions were by
instinct, their activities intuitional. Their largest manufacture
was of creeds: almost they were monopolists of revealed religions.
Three of these efforts had endured among them: two of the three had
also borne export (in modified forms) to non-Semitic peoples.
Christianity, translated into the diverse spirits of Greek and
Latin and Teutonic tongues, had conquered Europe and America. Islam
in various transformations was subjecting Africa and parts of Asia.
These were Semitic successes. Their failures they kept to
themselves. The fringes of their deserts were strewn with broken
faiths.</p>

<p>It was significant that this wrack of fallen religions lay about
the meeting of the desert and the sown. It pointed to the
generation of all these creeds. They were assertions, not
arguments; so they required a prophet to set them forth. The Arabs
said there had been forty thousand prophets: we had record of at
least some hundreds. None of them had been of the wilderness; but
their lives were after a pattern. Their birth set them in crowded
places. An unintelligible passionate yearning drove them out into
the desert. There they lived a greater or lesser time in meditation
and physical abandonment; and thence they returned with their
imagined message articulate, to preach it to their old, and now
doubting, associates. The founders of the three great creeds
fulfilled this cycle: their possible coincidence was proved a law
by the parallel life-histories of the myriad others, the
unfortunate who failed, whom we might judge of no less true
profession, but for whom time and disillusion had not heaped up dry
souls ready to be set on fire. To the thinkers of the town the
impulse into Nitria had ever been irresistible, not probably that
they found God dwelling there, but that in its solitude they heard
more certainly the living word they brought with them.</p>

<p>The common base of all the Semitic creeds, winners or losers,
was the ever present idea of world-worthlessness. Their profound
reaction from matter led them to preach bareness, renunciation,
poverty; and the atmosphere of this invention stifled the minds of
the desert pitilessly. A first knowledge of their sense of the
purity of rarefaction was given me in early years, when we had
ridden far out over the rolling plains of North Syria to a ruin of
the Roman period which the Arabs believed was made by a prince of
the border as a desert-palace for his queen. The clay of its
building was said to have been kneaded for greater richness, not
with water, but with the precious essential oils of flowers. My
guides, sniffing the air like dogs, led me from crumbling room to
room, saying, 'This is jessamine, this violet, this rose'.</p>

<p>But at last Dahoum drew me: 'Come and smell the very sweetest
scent of all', and we went into the main lodging, to the gaping
window sockets of its eastern face, and there drank with open
mouths of the effortless, empty, eddyless wind of the desert,
throbbing past. That slow breath had been born somewhere beyond the
distant Euphrates and had dragged its way across many days and
nights of dead grass, to its first obstacle, the man-made walls of
our broken palace. About them it seemed to fret and linger,
murmuring in baby-speech. 'This,' they told me, 'is the best: it
has no taste.' My Arabs were turning their backs on perfumes and
luxuries to choose the things in which mankind had had no share or
part.</p>

<p>The Beduin of the desert, born and grown up in it, had embraced
with all his soul this nakedness too harsh for volunteers, for the
reason, felt but inarticulate, that there he found himself
indubitably free. He lost material ties, comforts, all
superfluities and other complications to achieve a personal liberty
which haunted starvation and death. He saw no virtue in poverty
herself: he enjoyed the little vices and luxuries&mdash;coffee,
fresh water, women&mdash;which he could still preserve. In his life
he had air and winds, sun and light, open spaces and a great
emptiness. There was no human effort, no fecundity in Nature: just
the heaven above and the unspotted earth beneath. There
unconsciously he came near God. God was to him not anthropomorphic,
not tangible, not moral nor ethical, not concerned with the world
or with him, not natural: but the being [GREEK-see image 'Greek
image 1' below], thus qualified not by divestiture but by
investiture, a comprehending Being, the egg of all activity, with
nature and matter just a glass reflecting Him.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0100111h-images/0100111h-03.jpg">
</p>

<p><b>Greek image 1</b>
</p>
</center>

<p>The Beduin could not look for God within him: he was too sure
that he was within God. He could not conceive anything which was or
was not God, Who alone was great; yet there was a homeliness, an
everyday-ness of this climatic Arab God, who was their eating and
their fighting and their lusting, the commonest of their thoughts,
their familiar resource and companion, in a way impossible to those
whose God is so wistfully veiled from them by despair of their
carnal unworthiness of Him and by the decorum of formal worship.
Arabs felt no incongruity in bringing God into the weaknesses and
appetites of their least creditable causes. He was the most
familiar of their words; and indeed we lost much eloquence when
making Him the shortest and ugliest of our monosyllables.</p>

<p>This creed of the desert seemed inexpressible in words, and
indeed in thought. It was easily felt as an influence, and those
who went into the desert long enough to forget its open spaces and
its emptiness were inevitably thrust upon God as the only refuge
and rhythm of being. The Bedawi might be a nominal Sunni, or a
nominal Wahabi, or anything else in the Semitic compass, and he
would take it very lightly, a little in the manner of the watchmen
at Zion's gate who drank beer and laughed in Zion because they were
Zionists. Each individual nomad had his revealed religion, not oral
or traditional or expressed, but instinctive in himself; and so we
got all the Semitic creeds with (in character and essence) a stress
on the emptiness of the world and the fullness of God; and
according to the power and opportunity of the believer was the
expression of them.</p>

<p>The desert dweller could not take credit for his belief. He had
never been either evangelist or proselyte. He arrived at this
intense condensation of himself in God by shutting his eyes to the
world, and to all the complex possibilities latent in him which
only contact with wealth and temptations could bring forth. He
attained a sure trust and a powerful trust, but of how narrow a
field! His sterile experience robbed him of compassion and
perverted his human kindness to the image of the waste in which he
hid. Accordingly he hurt himself, not merely to be free, but to
please himself. There followed a delight in pain, a cruelty which
was more to him than goods. The desert Arab found no joy like the
joy of voluntarily holding back. He found luxury in abnegation,
renunciation, self restraint. He made nakedness of the mind as
sensuous as nakedness of the body. He saved his own soul, perhaps,
and without danger, but in a hard selfishness. His desert was made
a spiritual ice-house, in which was preserved intact but unimproved
for all ages a vision of the unity of God. To it sometimes the
seekers from the outer world could escape for a season and look
thence in detachment at the nature of the generation they would
convert.</p>

<p>This faith of the desert was impossible in the towns. It was at
once too strange, too simple, too impalpable for export and common
use. The idea, the ground-belief of all Semitic creeds was waiting
there, but it had to be diluted to be made comprehensible to us.
The scream of a bat was too shrill for many ears: the desert spirit
escaped through our coarser texture. The prophets returned from the
desert with their glimpse of God, and through their stained medium
(as through a dark glass) showed something of the majesty and
brilliance whose full vision would blind, deafen, silence us, serve
us as it had served the Beduin, setting him uncouth, a man
apart.</p>

<p>The disciples, in the endeavour to strip themselves and their
neighbours of all things according to the Master's word, stumbled
over human weaknesses and failed. To live, the villager or townsman
must fill himself each day with the pleasures of acquisition and
accumulation, and by rebound off circumstance become the grossest
and most material of men. The shining contempt of life which led
others into the barest asceticism drove him to despair. He
squandered himself heedlessly, as a spendthrift: ran through his
inheritance of flesh in hasty longing for the end. The Jew in the
Metropole at Brighton, the miser, the worshipper of Adonis, the
lecher in the stews of Damascus were alike signs of the Semitic
capacity for enjoyment, and expressions of the same nerve which
gave us at the other pole the self-denial of the Essenes, or the
early Christians, or the first Khalifas, finding the way to heaven
fairest for the poor in spirit. The Semite hovered between lust and
self-denial.</p>

<p>Arabs could be swung on an idea as on a cord; for the unpledged
allegiance of their minds made them obedient servants. None of them
would escape the bond till success had come, and with it
responsibility and duty and engagements. Then the idea was gone and
the work ended&mdash;in ruins. Without a creed they could be taken
to the four corners of the world (but not to heaven) by being shown
the riches of earth and the pleasures of it; but if on the road,
led in this fashion, they met the prophet of an idea, who had
nowhere to lay his head and who depended for his food on charity or
birds, then they would all leave their wealth for his inspiration.
They were incorrigibly children of the idea, feckless and
colour-blind, to whom body and spirit were for ever and inevitably
opposed. Their mind was strange and dark, full of depressions and
exaltations, lacking in rule, but with more of ardour and more
fertile in belief than any other in the world. They were a people
of starts, for whom the abstract was the strongest motive, the
process of infinite courage and variety, and the end nothing. They
were as unstable as water, and like water would perhaps finally
prevail. Since the dawn of life, in successive waves they had been
dashing themselves against the coasts of flesh. Each wave was
broken, but, like the sea, wore away ever so little of the granite
on which it failed, and some day, ages yet, might roll unchecked
over the place where the material world had been, and God would
move upon the face of those waters. One such wave (and not the
least) I raised and rolled before the breath of an idea, till it
reached its crest, and toppled over and fell at Damascus. The wash
of that wave, thrown back by the resistance of vested things, will
provide the matter of the following wave, when in fullness of time
the sea shall be raised once more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>The first great rush round the Mediterranean had shown the world
the power of an excited Arab for a short spell of intense physical
activity; but when the effort burned out the lack of endurance and
routine in the Semitic mind became as evident. The provinces they
had overrun they neglected, out of sheer distaste of system, and
had to seek the help of their conquered subjects, or of more
vigorous foreigners, to administer their ill-knit and inchoate
empires. So, early in the Middle Ages, the Turks found a footing in
the Arab States, first as servants, then as helpers, and then as a
parasite growth which choked the life out of the old body politic.
The last phase was of enmity, when the Hulagus or Timurs sated
their blood lust, burning and destroying everything which irked
them with a pretension of superiority.</p>

<p>Arab civilizations had been of an abstract nature, moral and
intellectual rather than applied; and their lack of public spirit
made their excellent private qualities futile. They were fortunate
in their epoch: Europe had fallen barbarous; and the memory of
Greek and Latin learning was fading from men's minds. By contrast
the imitative exercise of the Arabs seemed cultured, their mental
activity progressive, their state prosperous. They had performed
real service in preserving something of a classical past for a
mediaeval future.</p>

<p>With the coming of the Turks this happiness became a dream. By
stages the Semites of Asia passed under their yoke, and found it a
slow death. Their goods were stripped from them; and their spirits
shrivelled in the numbing breath of a military Government. Turkish
rule was gendarme rule, and Turkish political theory as crude as
its practice. The Turks taught the Arabs that the interests of a
sect were higher than those of patriotism: that the petty concerns
of the province were more than nationality. They led them by subtle
dissensions to distrust one another. Even the Arabic language was
banished from courts and offices, from the Government service, and
from superior schools. Arabs might only serve the State by
sacrifice of their racial characteristics. These measures were not
accepted quietly. Semitic tenacity showed itself in the many
rebellions of Syria, Mesopotamia and Arabia against the grosser
forms of Turkish penetration; and resistance was also made to the
more insidious attempts at absorption. The Arabs would not give up
their rich and flexible tongue for crude Turkish: instead, they
filled Turkish with Arabic words, and held to the treasures of
their own literature.</p>

<p>They lost their geographical sense, and their racial and
political and historical memories; but they clung the more tightly
to their language, and erected it almost into a fatherland of its
own. The first duty of every Moslem was to study the Koran, the
sacred book of Islam, and incidentally the greatest Arab literary
monument. The knowledge that this religion was his own, and that
only he was perfectly qualified to understand and practise it, gave
every Arab a standard by which to judge the banal achievements of
the Turk.</p>

<p>Then came the Turkish revolution, the fall of Abdul Hamid, and
the supremacy of the Young Turks. The horizon momentarily broadened
for the Arabs. The Young-Turk movement was a revolt against the
hierarchic conception of Islam and the pan-Islamic theories of the
old Sultan, who had aspired, by making himself spiritual director
of the Moslem world, to be also (beyond appeal) its director in
temporal affairs. These young politicians rebelled and threw him
into prison, under the impulse of constitutional theories of a
sovereign state. So, at a time when Western Europe was just
beginning to climb out of nationality into internationality, and to
rumble with wars far removed from problems of race, Western Asia
began to climb out of Catholicism into nationalist politics, and to
dream of wars for self-government and self-sovereignty, instead of
for faith or dogma. This tendency had broken out first and most
strongly in the Near East, in the little Balkan States, and had
sustained them through an almost unparalleled martyrdom to their
goal of separation from Turkey. Later there had been nationalist
movements in Egypt, in India, in Persia, and finally in
Constantinople, where they were fortified and made pointed by the
new American ideas in education: ideas which, when released in the
old high Oriental atmosphere, made an explosive mixture. The
American schools, teaching by the method of inquiry, encouraged
scientific detachment and free exchange of views. Quite without
intention they taught revolution, since it was impossible for an
individual to be modern in Turkey and at the same time loyal, if he
had been born of one of the subject races&mdash;Greeks, Arabs,
Kurds, Armenians or Albanians&mdash;over whom the Turks were so
long helped to keep dominion.</p>

<p>The Young Turks, in the confidence of their first success, were
carried away by the logic of their principles, and as protest
against Pan-Islam preached Ottoman brotherhood. The gullible
subject races&mdash;far more numerous than the Turks
themselves&mdash;believed that they were called upon to co-operate
in building a new East. Rushing to die task (full of Herbert
Spencer and Alexander Hamilton) they laid down platforms of
sweeping ideas, and hailed the Turks as partners. The Turks,
terrified at the forces they had let loose, drew the fires as
suddenly as they had stoked them. Turkey made Turkish for the
Turks&mdash;<i>Yeni-Turan</i>&mdash;became the cry. Later on, this
policy would turn them towards the rescue of their
irredenti&mdash;the Turkish populations subject to Russia in
Central Asia; but, first of all, they must purge their Empire of
such irritating subject races as resisted the ruling stamp. The
Arabs, the largest alien component of Turkey, must first be dealt
with. Accordingly the Arab deputies were scattered, the Arab
societies forbidden, the Arab notables proscribed. Arabic
manifestations and the Arabic language were suppressed by Enver
Pasha more sternly than by Abdul Hamid before him.</p>

<p>However, the Arabs had tasted freedom: they could not change
their ideas as quickly as their conduct; and the staffer spirits
among them were not easily to be put down. They read the Turkish
papers, putting 'Arab' for Turk' in the patriotic exhortations.
Suppression charged them with unhealthy violence. Deprived of
constitutional outlets they became revolutionary. The Arab
societies went underground, and changed from liberal clubs into
conspiracies. The Akhua, the Arab mother society, was publicly
dissolved. It was replaced in Mesopotamia by the dangerous Ahad, a
very secret brotherhood, limited almost entirely to Arab officers
in the Turkish Army, who swore to acquire the military knowledge of
their masters, and to turn it against them, in the service of the
Arab people, when the moment of rebellion came.</p>

<p>It was a large society, with a sure base in the wild part of
Southern Irak, where Sayid Taleb, the young John Wilkes of the Arab
movement, held the power in his unprincipled fingers. To it
belonged seven out of every ten Mesopotamian-born officers; and
their counsel was so well kept that members of it held high command
in Turkey to the last. When the crash came, and Allenby rode across
Armageddon and Turkey fell, one vice-president of the society was
commanding the broken fragments of the Palestine armies on the
retreat, and another was directing the Turkish forces across-Jordan
in the Amman area. Yet later, after the armistice, great places in
the Turkish service were still held by men ready to turn on their
masters at a word from their Arab leaders. To most of them the word
was never given; for those societies were pro-Arab only, willing to
fight for nothing but Arab independence; and they could see no
advantage in supporting the Allies rather than the Turks, since
they did not believe our assurances that we would leave them free.
Indeed, many of them preferred an Arabia united by Turkey in
miserable subjection, to an Arabia divided up and slothful under
the easier control of several European powers in spheres of
influence.</p>

<p>Greater than the Ahad was the Fetah, the society of freedom in
Syria. The landowners, the writers, the doctors, the great public
servants linked themselves in this society with a common oath,
passwords, signs, a press and a central treasury, to ruin the
Turkish Empire. With the noisy facility of the Syrian&mdash;an
ape-like people having much of the Japanese quickness, but
shallow&mdash;they speedily built up a formidable organization.
They looked outside for help, and expected freedom to come by
entreaty, not by sacrifice. They corresponded with Egypt, with the
Ahad (whose members, with true Mesopotamian dourness, rather
despised them), with the Sherif of Mecca, and with Great Britain:
everywhere seeking the ally to serve their turn. They also were
deadly secret; and the Government, though it suspected their
existence, could find no credible evidence of their leaders or
membership. It had to hold its hand until it could strike with
evidence enough to satisfy the English and French diplomats who
acted as modern public opinion in Turkey. The war in 1914 withdrew
these agents, and left the Turkish Government free to strike.</p>

<p>Mobilization put all power into the hands of those
members&mdash;Enver, Talaat and Jemal&mdash;who were at once the
most ruthless, the most logical, and the most ambitious of the
Young Turks. They set themselves to stamp out all non-Turkish
currents in the State, especially Arab and Armenian nationalism.
For the first step they found a specious and convenient weapon in
the secret papers of a French Consul in Syria, who left behind him
in his Consulate copies of correspondence (about Arab freedom)
which had passed between him and an Arab club, not connected with
the Fetah but made up of the more talkative and less formidable
<i>intelligenzia</i> of the Syrian coast. The Turks, of course,
were delighted; for 'colonial' aggression in North Africa had given
the French a black reputation in the Arabic-speaking Moslem world;
and it served Jemal well to show his co-religionists that these
Arab nationalists were infidel enough to prefer France to
Turkey.</p>

<p>In Syria, of course, his disclosures had little novelty; but the
members of the society were known and respected, if somewhat
academic, persons; and their arrest and condemnation, and the crop
of deportations, exiles, and executions to which their trial led,
moved the country to its depths, and taught the Arabs of the Fetah
that if they did not profit by their lesson, the fate of the
Armenians would be upon them. The Armenians had been well armed and
organized; but their leaders had failed them. They had been
disarmed and destroyed piecemeal, the men by massacre, the women
and children by being driven and overdriven along the wintry roads
into the desert, naked and hungry, the common prey of any
passer-by, until death took them. The Young Turks had killed the
Armenians, not because they were Christians, but because they were
Armenians; and for the same reason they herded Arab Moslems and
Arab Christians into the same prison, and hanged them together on
the same scaffold. Jemal Pasha united all classes, conditions and
creeds in Syria, under pressure of a common misery and peril, and
so made a concerted revolt possible.</p>

<p>The Turks suspected the Arab officers and soldiers in the Army,
and hoped to use against them the scattering tactics which had
served against the Armenians. At first transport difficulties stood
in their way; and there came a dangerous concentration of Arab
divisions (nearly one third of the original Turkish Army was Arabic
speaking) in North Syria early in 1915. They broke these up when
possible, marching them off to Europe, to the Dardanelles, to the
Caucasus, or the Canal&mdash;anywhere, so long as they were put
quickly into the firing-line, or withdrawn far from the sight and
help of their compatriots. A Holy War was proclaimed to give the
'Union and Progress' banner something of the traditional sanctity
of the Caliph's battle-order in the eyes of the old clerical
elements; and the Sherif of Mecca was invited&mdash;or rather
ordered&mdash;to echo the cry.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>The position of the Sherif of Mecca had long been anomalous. The
title of 'Sherif implied descent from the prophet Mohammed through
his daughter Fatima, and Hassan, her elder son. Authentic Sherifs
were inscribed on the family tree&mdash;an immense roll preserved
at Mecca, in custody of the Emir of Mecca, the elected Sherif of
Sherifs, supposed to be the senior and noblest of all. The
prophet's family had held temporal rule in Mecca for the last nine
hundred years, and counted some two thousand persons.</p>

<p>The old Ottoman Governments regarded this clan of manticratic
peers with a mixture of reverence and distrust. Since they were too
strong to be destroyed, the Sultan salved his dignity by solemnly
confirming their Emir in place. This empty approval acquired
dignity by lapse of time, until the new holder began to feel that
it added a final seal to his election. At last the Turks found that
they needed the Hejaz under their unquestioned sway as part of the
stage furniture for their new pan-Islamic notion. The fortuitous
opening of the Suez Canal enabled them to garrison the Holy Cities.
They projected the Hejaz Railway, and increased Turkish influence
among the tribes by money, intrigue, and armed expeditions.</p>

<p>As the Sultan grew stronger there he ventured to assert himself
more and more alongside the Sherif, even in Mecca itself, and upon
occasion ventured to depose a Sherif too magnificent for his views,
and to appoint a successor from a rival family of the clan in hopes
of winning the usual advantages from dissension. Finally, Abdul
Hamid took away some of the family to Constantinople into
honourable captivity. Amongst these was Hussein ibn Ali, the future
ruler, who was held a prisoner for nearly eighteen years. He took
the opportunity to provide his sons&mdash;Ali, Abdulla, Feisal, and
Zeid&mdash;with the modern education and experience which
afterwards enabled them to lead the Arab armies to success.</p>

<p>When Abdul Hamid fell, the less wily Young Turks reversed his
policy and sent back Sherif Hussein to Mecca as Emir. He at once
set to work unobtrusively to restore the power of the Emirate, and
strengthened himself on the old basis, keeping the while close and
friendly touch with Constantinople through his sons Abdulla,
vice-chairman of the Turkish House, and Feisal, member for Jidda.
They kept him informed of political opinion in the capital until
war broke out, when they returned in haste to Mecca.</p>

<p>The outbreak of war made trouble in the Hejaz. The pilgrimage
ceased, and with it the revenues and business of the Holy Cities.
There was reason to fear that the Indian food-ships would cease to
come (since the Sherif became technically an enemy subject); and as
the province produced almost no food of its own, it would be
precariously dependent on the goodwill of the Turks, who might
starve it by closing the Hejaz Railway. Hussein had never been
entirely at the Turks' mercy before; and at this unhappy moment
they particularly needed his adherence to their 'Jehad', the Holy
War of all Moslems against Christianity.</p>

<p>To become popularly effective this must be endorsed by Mecca;
and if endorsed it might plunge the East in blood. Hussein was
honourable, shrewd, obstinate and deeply pious. He felt that the
Holy War was doctrinally incompatible with an aggressive war, and
absurd with a Christian ally: Germany. So he refused the Turkish
demand, and made at the same time a dignified appeal to the Allies
not to starve his province for what was in no way his people's
fault. The Turks in reply at once instituted a partial blockade of
the Hejaz by controlling the traffic on the pilgrim railway. The
British left his coast open to specially-regulated food
vessels.</p>

<p>The Turkish demand was, however, not the only one which the
Sherif received. In January 1915, Yisin, head of the Mesopotamian
officers, Ali Riza, head of the Damascus officers, and Abd el Ghani
el Areisi, for the Syrian civilians, sent down to him a concrete
proposal for a military mutiny in Syria against the Turks. The
oppressed people of Mesopotamia and Syria, the committees of the
Ahad and the Fetah, were calling out to him as the Father of the
Arabs, the Moslem of Moslems, their greatest prince, their oldest
notable, to save them from the sinister designs of Talaat and
Jemal.</p>

<p>Hussein, as politician, as prince, as moslem, as modernist, and
as nationalist, was forced to listen to their appeal. He sent
Feisal, his third son, to Damascus, to discuss their projects as
his representative, and to make a report. He sent Ali, his eldest
son, to Medina, with orders to raise quietly, on any excuse he
pleased, troops from villagers and tribesmen of the Hejaz, and to
hold them ready for action if Feisal called. Abdulla, his politic
second son, was to sound the British by letter, to learn what would
be their attitude towards a possible Arab revolt against
Turkey.</p>

<p>Feisal reported in January 1915, that local conditions were
good, but that the general war was not going well for their hopes.
In Damascus were three divisions of Arab troops ready for
rebellion. In Aleppo two other divisions, riddled with Arab
nationalism, were sure to join in if the others began. There was
only one Turkish division this side of the Taurus, so that it was
certain that the rebels would get possession of Syria at the first
effort. On the other hand, public opinion was less ready for
extreme measures, and the military class quite sure that Germany
would win the war and win it soon. If, however, the Allies landed
their Australian Expedition (preparing in Egypt) at Alexandretta,
and so covered the Syrian flank, then it would be wise and safe to
risk a final German victory and the need to make a previous
separate peace with the Turks.</p>

<p>Delay followed, as the Allies went to the Dardanelles, and not
to Alexandretta. Feisal went after them to get first-hand knowledge
of Gallipoli conditions, since a breakdown of Turkey would be the
Arab signal. Then followed stagnation through the months of the
Dardanelles campaign. In that slaughter-house the remaining Ottoman
first-line army was destroyed. The disaster to Turkey of the
accumulated losses was so great that Feisal came back to Syria,
judging it a possible moment in which to strike, but found that
meanwhile the local situation had become unfavourable.</p>

<p>His Syrian supporters were under arrest or in hiding, and their
friends being hanged in scores on political charges. He found the
well-disposed Arab divisions either exiled to distant fronts, or
broken up in drafts and distributed among Turkish units. The Arab
peasantry were in the grip of Turkish military service, and Syria
prostrate before the merciless Jemal Pasha. His assets had
disappeared. He wrote to his father counselling further delay, till
England should be ready and Turkey in extremities. Unfortunately,
England was in a deplorable condition. Her forces were falling back
shattered from the Dardanelles. The slow-drawn agony of Kut was in
its last stage; and the Senussi rising, coincident with the entry
of Bulgaria, threatened her on new flanks.</p>

<p>Feisal's position was hazardous in the extreme. He was at the
mercy of the members of the secret society, whose president he had
been before the war. He had to live as the guest of Jemal Pasha, in
Damascus, rubbing up his military knowledge; for his brother Ali
was raising the troops in Hejaz on the pretext that he and Feisal
would lead them against the Suez Canal to help the Turks. So
Feisal, as a good Ottoman and officer in the Turkish service, had
to live at headquarters, and endure acquiescingly the insults and
indignities heaped upon his race by the bully Jemal in his
cups.</p>

<p>Jemal would send for Feisal and take him to the hanging of his
Syrian friends. These victims of justice dared not show that they
knew Feisal's real hopes, any more than he dared show his mind by
word or look, since disclosure would have condemned his family and
perhaps their race to the same fate. Only once did he burst out
that these executions would cost Jemal all that he was trying to
avoid; and it took the intercessions of his Constantinople friends,
chief men in Turkey, to save him from the price of these rash
words.</p>

<p>Feisal's correspondence with his father was an adventure in
itself. They communicated by means of old retainers of the family,
men above suspicion, who went up and down the Hejaz Railway,
carrying letters in sword-hilts, in cakes, sewn between the soles
of sandals, or in invisible writings on the wrappers of harmless
packages. In all of them Feisal reported unfavourable things, and
begged his father to postpone action till a wiser time.</p>

<p>Hussein, however, was not a whit cast down by Emir Feisal's
discouragements. The Young Turks in his eyes were so many godless
transgressors of their creed and their human duty&mdash;traitors to
the spirit of the time, and to the higher interests of Islam.
Though an old man of sixty-five, he was cheerfully determined to
wage war against them, relying upon justice to cover the cost.
Hussein trusted so much in God that he let his military sense lie
fallow, and thought Hejaz able to fight it out with Turkey on a
fair field. So he sent Abd el Kader el Abdu to Feisal with a letter
that all was now ready for inspection by him in Medina before the
troops started for the front Feisal informed Jemal, and asked leave
to go down, but, to his dismay, Jemal replied that Enver Pasha, the
Generalissimo, was on his way to the province, and that they would
visit Medina together and inspect them. Feisal had planned to raise
his father's crimson banner as soon as he arrived in Medina, and so
to take the Turks unawares; and here he was going to be saddled
with two uninvited guests to whom, by the Arab law of hospitality,
he could do no harm, and who would probably delay his action so
long that the whole secret of the revolt would be in jeopardy!</p>

<p>In the end matters passed off well, though the irony of the
review was terrible. Enver, Jemal and Feisal watched the troops
wheeling and turning in the dusty plain outside the city gate,
rushing up and down in mimic camel-battle, or spurring their horses
in the javelin game after immemorial Arab fashion. 'And are all
these volunteers for the Holy War?' asked Enver at last, turning to
Feisal. 'Yes,' said Feisal. Willing to fight to the death against
the enemies of the faithful?' Yes,' said Feisal again; and then the
Arab chiefs came up to be presented, and Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein,
of Modhig, drew him aside whispering, 'My Lord, shall we kill them
now?' and Feisal said, 'No, they are our guests.'</p>

<p>The sheikhs protested further; for they believed that so they
could finish off the war in two blows. They were determined to
force Feisal's hand; and he had to go among them, just out of
earshot but in full view, and plead for the lives of the Turkish
dictators, who had murdered his best friends on the scaffold. In
the end he had to make excuses, take the party back quickly to
Medina, picket the banqueting hall with his own slaves, and escort
Enver and Jemal back to Damascus to save them from death on the
way. He explained this laboured courtesy by the plea that it was
the Arab manner to devote everything to guests; but Enver and Jemal
being deeply suspicious of what they had seen, imposed a strict
blockade of the Hejaz, and ordered large Turkish reinforcements
thither. They wanted to detain Feisal in Damascus; but telegrams
came from Medina claiming his immediate return to prevent disorder,
and, reluctantly, Jemal let him go on condition that his suite
remained behind as hostages.</p>

<p>Feisal found Medina full of Turkish troops, with the staff and
headquarters of the Twelfth Army Corps under Fakhri Pasha, the
courageous old butcher who had bloodily 'purified' Zeitun and Urfa
of Armenians. Clearly the Turks had taken warning, and Feisal's
hope of a surprise rush, winning success almost without a shot, had
become impossible. However, it was too late for prudence. From
Damascus four days later his suite took horse and rode out east
into the desert to take refuge with Nuri Shaalan, the Beduin
chieftain; and the same day Feisal showed his hand. When he raised
the Arab flag, the pan-Islamic supra-national State, for which
Abdul Hamid had massacred and worked and died, and the German hope
of the co-operation of Islam in the world-plans of the Kaiser,
passed into the realm of dreams. By the mere fact of his rebellion
the Sherif had closed these two fantastic chapters of history.</p>

<p>Rebellion was the gravest step which political men could take,
and the success or failure of the Arab revolt was a gamble too
hazardous for prophecy. Yet, for once, fortune favoured the bold
player, and the Arab epic tossed up its stormy road from birth
through weakness, pain and doubt, to red victory. It was the just
end to an adventure which had dared so much, but after the victory
there came a slow time of disillusion, and then a night in which
the fighting men found that all their hopes had failed them. Now,
at last, may there have come to them the white peace of the end, in
the knowledge that they achieved a deathless thing, a lucent
inspiration to the children of their race.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>I had been many years going up and down the Semitic East before
the war, learning the manners of the villagers and tribesmen and
citizens of Syria and Mesopotamia. My poverty had constrained me to
mix with the humbler classes, those seldom met by European
travellers, and thus my experiences gave me an unusual angle of
view, which enabled me to understand and think for the ignorant
many as well as for the more enlightened whose rare opinions
mattered, not so much for the day, as for the morrow. In addition,
I had seen something of the political forces working in the minds
of the Middle East, and especially had noted everywhere sure signs
of the decay of imperial Turkey.</p>

<p>Turkey was dying of overstrain, of the attempt, with diminished
resources, to hold, on traditional terms, the whole Empire
bequeathed to it. The sword had been the virtue of the children of
Othman, and swords had passed out of fashion nowadays, in favour of
deadlier and more scientific weapons. Life was growing too
complicated for this child-like people, whose strength had lain in
simplicity, and patience, and in their capacity for sacrifice. They
were the slowest of the races of Western Asia, little fitted to
adapt themselves to new sciences of government and life, still less
to invent any new arts for themselves. Their administration had
become perforce an affair of files and telegrams, of high finance,
eugenics, calculations. Inevitably the old governors, who had
governed by force of hand or force of character, illiterate,
direct, personal, had to pass away. The rule was transferred to new
men, with agility and suppleness to stoop to machinery. The shallow
and half-polished committee of the Young Turks were descendants of
Greeks, Albanians, Circassians, Bulgars, Armenians,
Jews&mdash;anything but Seljuks or Ottomans. The commons ceased to
feel in tune with their governors, whose culture was Levantine, and
whose political theory was French. Turkey was decaying; and only
the knife might keep health in her.</p>

<p>Loving the old ways steadily, the Anatolian remained a beast of
burden in his village and an uncomplaining soldier abroad, while
the subject races of the Empire, who formed nearly seven-tenths of
its total population, grew daily in strength and knowledge; for
their lack of tradition and responsibility, as well as their
lighter and quicker minds, disposed them to accept new ideas. The
former natural awe and supremacy of the Turkish name began to fade
in the face of wider comparison. This changing balance of Turkey
and the subject provinces involved growing garrisons if the old
ground was to be retained. Tripoli, Albania, Thrace, Yemen, Hejaz,
Syria, Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, Armenia, were all outgoing accounts,
burdens on the peasants of Anatolia, yearly devouring a larger
draft. The burden fell heaviest on the poor villages, and each year
made these poor villages yet more poor.</p>

<p>The conscripts took their fate unquestioning: resignedly, after
the custom of Turkish peasantry. They were like sheep, neutrals
without vice or virtue. Left alone, they did nothing, or perhaps
sat dully on the ground. Ordered to be kind, and without haste they
were as good friends and as generous enemies as might be found.
Ordered to outrage their fathers or disembowel their mothers, they
did it as calmly as they did nothing, or did well. There was about
them a hopeless, fever-wasted lack of initiative, which made them
the most biddable, most enduring, and least spirited soldiers in
the world.</p>

<p>Such men were natural victims of their showy-vicious Levantine
officers, to be driven to death or thrown away by neglect without
reckoning. Indeed, we found them just kept chopping-blocks of their
commanders' viler passions. So cheap did they rate them, that in
connection with them they used none of the ordinary precautions.
Medical examination of some batches of Turkish prisoners found
nearly half of them with unnaturally acquired venereal disease. Pox
and its like were not understood in the country; and the infection
ran from one to another through the battalion, where the conscripts
served for six or seven years, till at the end of their period the
survivors, if they came from decent homes, were ashamed to return,
and drifted either into the gendarmerie service, or, as broken men,
into casual labour about the towns; and so the birth-rate fell. The
Turkish peasantry in Anatolia were dying of their military
service.</p>

<p>We could see that a new factor was needed in the East, some
power or race which would outweigh the Turks in numbers, in output,
and in mental activity. No encouragement was given us by history to
think that these qualities could be supplied ready-made from
Europe. The efforts of European Powers to keep a footing in the
Asiatic Levant had been uniformly disastrous, and we disliked no
Western people enough to inveigle them into further attempts. Our
successor and solution must be local; and fortunately the standard
of efficiency required was local also. The competition would be
with Turkey; and Turkey was rotten.</p>

<p>Some of us judged that there was latent power enough and to
spare in the Arabic peoples (the greatest component of the old
Turkish Empire), a prolific Semitic agglomeration, great in
religious thought, reasonably industrious, mercantile, politic, yet
solvent rather than dominant in character. They had served a term
of five hundred years under the Turkish harrow, and had begun to
dream of liberty; so when at last England fell out with Turkey, and
war was let loose in the East and West at once, we who believed we
held an indication of the future set out to bend England's efforts
towards fostering the new Arabic world in hither Asia.</p>

<p>We were not many; and nearly all of us rallied round Clayton,
the chief of Intelligence, civil and military, in Egypt. Clayton
made the perfect leader for such a band of wild men as we were. He
was calm, detached, clear-sighted, of unconscious courage in
assuming responsibility. He gave an open run to his subordinates.
His own views were general, like his knowledge; and he worked by
influence rather than by loud direction. It was not easy to descry
his influence. He was like water, or permeating oil, creeping
silently and insistently through everything. It was not possible to
say where Clayton was and was not, and how much really belonged to
him. He never visibly led; but his ideas were abreast of those who
did: he impressed men by his sobriety, and by a certain quiet and
stately moderation of hope. In practical matters he was loose,
irregular, untidy, a man with whom independent men could bear.</p>

<p>The first of us was Ronald Storrs, Oriental Secretary of the
Residency, the most brilliant Englishman in the Near East, and
subtly efficient, despite his diversion of energy in love of music
and letters, of sculpture, painting, of whatever was beautiful in
the world's fruit. None the less, Storrs sowed what we reaped, and
was always first, and the great man among us. His shadow would have
covered our work and British policy in the East like a cloak, had
he been able to deny himself the world, and to prepare his mind and
body with the sternness of an athlete for a great fight.</p>

<p>George Lloyd entered our number. He gave us confidence, and with
his knowledge of money, proved a sure guide through the subways of
trade and politics, and a prophet upon the future arteries of the
Middle East. We would not have done so much so soon without his
partnership; but he was a restless soul, avid rather to taste than
to exhaust. To him many things were needful; and so he would not
stay very long with us. He did not see how much we liked him.</p>

<p>Then there was the imaginative advocate of unconvincing
world-movements, Mark Sykes: also a bundle of prejudices,
intuitions, half-sciences. His ideas were of the outside; and he
lacked patience to test his materials before choosing his style of
building. He would take an aspect of the truth, detach it from its
circumstances, inflate it, twist and model it, until its old
likeness and its new unlikeness together drew a laugh; and laughs
were his triumphs. His instincts lay in parody: by choice he was A
caricaturist rather than an artist, even in statesmanship. He saw
the odd in everything, and missed the even. He would sketch out in
a few dashes a new world, <i>all</i> out of scale, but vivid as a
vision of some sides of the thing we hoped. His help did us good
and harm. For this his last week in Paris tried to atone. He had
returned from A period of political duty in Syria, after his awful
realization of the true shape of his dreams, to say gallantly, I
was wrong: here is the truth'. His former friends would not see his
new earnestness, and thought him fickle and in error; and very soon
he died. It was a tragedy of tragedies, for the Arab sake.</p>

<p>Not a wild man, but <i>Mentor</i> to all of us was Hogarth, our
father confessor and adviser, who brought us the parallels and
lessons of history, and moderation, and courage. To the outsiders
he was peacemaker (I was all claws and teeth, and had a devil), and
made us favoured and listened to, for his weighty judgement. He had
a delicate sense of value, and would present clearly to us the
forces hidden behind the lousy rags and festering skins which we
knew as Arabs. Hogarth was our referee, and our untiring historian,
who gave us his great knowledge and careful wisdom even in the
smallest things, because he believed in what we were making. Behind
him stood Cornwallis, a man rude to look upon, but apparently
forged from one of those incredible metals with a melting-point of
thousands of degrees. So he could remain for months hotter than
other men's white-heat, and yet look cold and hard. Behind him
again were others, Newcombe, Parker, Herbert, Graves, all of the
creed, and labouring stoutly after their fashion.</p>

<p>We called ourselves 'Intrusive' as a band; for we meant to break
into the accepted halls of English foreign policy, and build a new
people in the East, despite the rails laid down for us by our
ancestors. Therefore from our hybrid intelligence office in Cairo
(a jangling place which for its incessant bells and bustle and
running to and fro, was likened by Aubrey Herbert to an oriental
railway station) we began to work upon all chiefs, far and near.
Sir Henry McMahon, High Commissioner in Egypt, was, of course, our
first effort; and his shrewd insight and tried, experienced mind
understood our design at once and judged it good. Others, like
Wemyss, Neil Malcolm, Wingate, supported us in their pleasure at
seeing the war turned constructive. Their advocacy confirmed in
Lord Kitchener the favourable impression he had derived years
before when Sherif Abdulla appealed to him in Egypt; and so McMahon
at last achieved our foundation stone, the understanding with the
Sherif of Mecca.</p>

<p>But before this we had had hopes of Mesopotamia. The beginning
of the Arab Independence Movement had been there, under the
vigorous but unscrupulous impulse of Seyid Taleb, and later of
Yasin el Hashimi and the military league. Aziz el Masri, Enver's
rival, who was living, much indebted to us, in Egypt, was an idol
of the Arab officers. He was approached by Lord Kitchener in the
first days of the war, with the hope of winning the Turkish
Mesopotamian forces to our side. Unfortunately Britain was bursting
then with confidence in an easy and early victory: the smashing of
Turkey was called a promenade. So the Indian Government was adverse
to any pledges to the Arab nationalists which might limit their
ambitions to make the intended Mesopotamian colony play the
self-sacrificing role of a Burma for the general good. It broke off
negotiations, rejected Aziz, and interned Sayid Taleb, who had
placed himself in our hands.</p>

<p>By brute force it marched then into Basra. The enemy troops in
Irak were nearly all Arabs in the unenviable predicament of having
to fight on behalf of their secular oppressors against a people
long envisaged as liberators, but who obstinately refused to play
the part. As may be imagined, they fought very badly. Our forces
won battle after battle till we came to think an Indian army better
than a Turkish army. There followed our rash advance to Ctesiphon,
where we met native Turkish troops whose full heart was in the
game, and were abruptly checked. We fell back, dazed; and the long
misery of Kut began.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our Government had repented, and, for reasons not
unconnected with the fall of Erzerum, sent me to Mesopotamia to see
what could be done by indirect means to relieve the beleaguered
garrison. The local British had the strongest objection to my
coming; and two Generals of them were good enough to explain to me
that my mission (which they did not really know) was dishonourable
to a soldier (which I was not). As a matter of fact it was too late
for action, with Kut just dying; and in consequence I did nothing
of what it was in my mind and power to do.</p>

<p>The conditions were ideal for an Arab movement. The people of
Nejef and Kerbela, far in the rear of Halil Pasha's army, were in
revolt against him. The surviving Arabs in Hali's army were, on his
own confession, openly disloyal to Turkey. The tribes of the Hai
and Euphrates would have turned our way had they seen signs of
grace in the British. Had we published the promises made to the
Sherif, or even the proclamation afterwards posted in captured
Bagdad, and followed it up, enough local fighting men would have
joined us to harry the Turkish line of communication between Bagdad
and Kut. A few weeks of that, and the enemy would either have been
forced to raise the siege and retire, or have themselves suffered
investment, outside Kut, nearly as stringent as the investment of
Townshend within it. Time to develop such a scheme could easily
have been gained. Had the British headquarters in Mesopotamia
obtained from the War Office eight more aeroplanes to increase the
daily carriage of food to the garrison of Kut, Townshend's
resistance might have been indefinitely prolonged. His defence was
Turkishly impregnable; and only blunders within and without forced
surrender upon him.</p>

<p>However, as this was not the way of the directing parties there,
I returned at once to Egypt; and till the end of the war the
British in Mesopotamia remained substantially an alien force
invading enemy territory, with the local people passively neutral
or sullenly against them, and in consequence had not the freedom of
movement and elasticity of Allenby in Syria, who entered the
country as a friend, with the local people actively on his side.
The factors of numbers, climate and communications favoured us in
Mesopotamia more than in Syria; and our higher command was, after
the beginning, no less efficient and experienced. But their
casualty lists compared with Allenby's, their wood-chopping tactics
compared with his rapier-play, showed how formidably an adverse
political situation was able to cramp a purely military
operation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p>Our check in Mesopotamia was a disappointment to us; but McMahon
continued his negotiations with Mecca, and finally brought them to
success despite the evacuation of Gallipoli, the surrender of Kut,
and the generally unfortunate aspect of the war at the moment. Few
people, even of those who knew all the negotiations, had really
believed that the Sherif would fight; consequently his eventual
rebellion and opening of his coast to our ships and help took us
and them by surprise.</p>

<p>We found our difficulties then only beginning. The credit of the
new factor was to McMahon and Clayton: professional jealousies
immediately raised their heads. Sir Archibald Murray, the General
in Egypt, wanted, naturally enough, no competitors and no competing
campaigns in his sphere. He disliked the civil power, which had so
long kept the peace between himself and General Maxwell. He could
not be entrusted with the Arabian affair; for neither he nor his
staff had the ethnological competence needed to deal with so
curious a problem. On the other hand, he could make the spectacle
of the High Commission running a private war sufficiently
ridiculous. His was a very nervous mind, fanciful and essentially
competitive.</p>

<p>He found help in his Chief of Staff, General Lynden Bell, a red
soldier, with an instinctive shuddering away from politicians, and
a conscientiously assumed heartiness.</p>

<p>Two of the General Staff officers followed their leaders full
cry; and so the unfortunate McMahon found himself deprived of Army
help and reduced to waging his war in Arabia with the assistance of
his Foreign Office Attache's.</p>

<p>Some appeared to resent a war which allowed outsiders to thrust
into their business. Also their training in suppression, by which
alone the daily trivialities of diplomacy were made to look like
man's work, had so sunk into them that when the more important
thing arrived, they made it trivial. Their feebleness of tone, and
niggling dishonesties to one another, angered the military to
disgust; and were bad for us, too, since they patently let down the
High Commissioner, whose boots the G&mdash;s were not good enough
to clean.</p>

<p>Wingate, who had complete confidence in his own grasp of the
situation in the Middle East, foresaw credit and great profit for
the country in the Arab development; but as criticism slowly beat
up against McMahon he dissociated himself from him, and London
began to hint that better use might be made by an experienced hand
of so subtle and involved a skein.</p>

<p>However it was, things in the Hejaz went from bad to worse. No
proper liaison was provided for the Arab forces in the field, no
military information was given the Sherifs, no tactical advice or
strategy was suggested, no attempt made to find out the local
conditions and adapt existing Allied resources in material to suit
their needs. The French Military Mission (which Clayton's prudence
had suggested be sent to Hejaz to soothe our very suspicious allies
by taking them behind the scenes and giving them a purpose there),
was permitted to carry on an elaborate intrigue against Sherif
Hussein in his towns of Jidda and Mecca, and to propose to him and
to the British authorities measures that must have ruined his cause
in the eyes of all Moslems. Wingate, now in military control of our
cooperation with the Sherif, was induced to land some foreign
troops at Rabegh, half-way between Medina and Mecca, for the
defence of Mecca and to hold up the further advance of the
reinvigorated Turks from Medina. McMahon, in the multitude of
counsellors, became confused, and gave a handle to Murray to cry
out against his inconsistencies. The Arab Revolt became
discredited; and Staff Officers in Egypt gleefully prophesied to us
its near failure and the stretching of Sherif Hussein's neck on a
Turkish scaffold.</p>

<p>My private position was not easy. As Staff Captain under Clayton
in Sir Archibald Murray's Intelligence Section, I was charged with
the 'distribution' of the Turkish Army and the preparation of maps.
By natural inclination I had added to them the invention of the
Arab Bulletin, a secret weekly record of Middle-Eastern politics;
and of necessity Clayton came more and more to need me in the
military wing of the Arab Bureau, the tiny intelligence and war
staff for foreign affairs, which he was now organizing for McMahon.
Eventually Clayton was driven out of the General Staff; and Colonel
Holdich, Murray's intelligence officer at Ismailia, took his place
in command of us. His first intention was to retain my services;
and, since he clearly did not need me, I interpreted this, not
without some friendly evidence, as a method of keeping me away from
the Arab affair. I decided that I must escape at once, if ever. A
straight request was refused; so I took to stratagems. I became, on
the telephone (G.H.Q. were at Ismailia, and I in Cairo) quite
intolerable to the Staff on the Canal. I took every opportunity to
rub into them their comparative ignorance and inefficiency in the
department of intelligence (not difficult!) and irritated them yet
further by literary airs, correcting Shavian split infinitives and
tautologies in their reports.</p>

<p>In a few days they were bubbling over on my account, and at last
determined to endure me no longer. I took this strategic
opportunity to ask for ten days' leave, saying that Storrs was
going down to Jidda on business with the Grand Sherif, and that I
would like a holiday and joyride in the Red Sea with him. They did
not love Storrs, and were glad to get rid of me for the moment. So
they agreed at once, and began to prepare against my return some
official shelf for me. Needless to say, I had no intention of
giving them such a chance; for, while very ready to hire my body
out on petty service, I hesitated to throw my mind frivolously
away. So I went to Clayton and confessed my affairs; and he
arranged for the Residency to make telegraphic application to the
Foreign Office for my transfer to the Arab Bureau. The Foreign
Office would treat directly with the War Office; and the Egypt
command would not hear of it, till all was ended.</p>

<p>Storrs and I then marched off together, happily. In the East
they swore that by three sides was the decent way across a square;
and my trick to escape was in this sense oriental. But I justified
myself by my confidence in the final success of the Arab Revolt if
properly advised. I had been a mover in its beginning; my hopes lay
in it. The fatalistic subordination of a professional soldier
(intrigue being unknown in the British army) would have made a
proper officer sit down and watch his plan of campaign wrecked by
men who thought nothing of it, and to whose spirit it made no
appeal. <i>Non nobis, domine</i>.</p>
