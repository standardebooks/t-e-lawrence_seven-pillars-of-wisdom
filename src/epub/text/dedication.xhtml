					<span>I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into my hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">and wrote my will across the sky in stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To earn you Freedom, the seven-pillared worthy house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">that your eyes might be shining for me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="rm">When we came.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Death seemed my servant on the road, till we were near</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">and saw you waiting:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When you smiled, and in sorrowful envy he outran me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">and took you apart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="rm">Into his quietness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Love, the way-weary, groped to your body, our brief wage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">ours for the moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before earthâ€™s soft hand explored your shape, and the blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">worms grew fat upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="rm">Your substance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Men prayed me that I set our work, the inviolate house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">as a memory of you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for fit monument I shattered it, unfinished: and now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The little things creep out to patch themselves hovels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">in the marred shadow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="rm">Of your gift.</span>
